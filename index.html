F1 has always been a place where both the mechanics and the drivers are able to push the boundaries of 
racing. I will be looking into the different ways that aerodynamics has evolved from the start of 
F1 in the 1950s to today talking about different tools which have helped to create the cars we see today
like CFD and wind tunnels, also I will go over some of the many innovations which have been used to increase 
the overall performance of the cars that have change F1 for ever like the floor, diffuser and the DRS. As 
well as this I will touch on the exiting future of F1 and how it will change the sport.
